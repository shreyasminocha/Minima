# Minima

Minima is an ultra minimal css boilerplate (largely) based on [Milligram](https://milligram.io). Minima offers a very minimal set of css rules and provides a great starting point for your web development projects.

## Usage

You can choose to either download Minima manually:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/path/to/minima.min.css">
```

Or source it from the [Rawgit CDN](https://rawgit.com).

[Milligram](https://milligram.io) offers more rules such as forms, buttons etc. If that would better fit your needs, make sure to check it out, it's awesome.
